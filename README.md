Feature engineering in machine learning involves creating, transforming, or selecting variables (features) from raw data to improve model performance. It includes:

1. **Creating New Features**: Deriving new features from existing ones, such as calculating age from a birth date.
2. **Transforming Features**: Applying mathematical transformations, like logarithms or scaling, to normalize data.
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converting categorical data into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
4. **Handling Missing Values**: Imputing missing values using mean, median, or mode, or using models to predict them.
5. **Selecting Features**: Choosing the most relevant features using statistical tests, correlation analysis, or algorithms like recursive feature elimination.

Effective feature engineering can significantly enhance model accuracy and robustness.
