Feature engineering in machine learning involves creating, transforming, or selecting variables (features) from raw data to enhance model performance. Key activities include:

1. **Creating New Features**: Deriving new features from existing ones, such as calculating age from a date of birth.
2. **Transforming Features**: Applying mathematical transformations, like logarithms or scaling, to standardize data.
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converting categorical data into numerical formats using methods like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
4. **Handling Missing Values**: Imputing missing values using techniques such as mean, median, or mode imputation, or predictive models.
5. **Selecting Features**: Identifying the most relevant features through statistical tests, correlation analysis, or algorithms like recursive feature elimination.

Effective feature engineering can greatly improve model accuracy and reliability.
